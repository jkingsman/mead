    ingredients: [
        '1.5 oz. finely grated fresh ginger (the younger the better; microplane suggested)',
        '6 oz. table sugar',
        '7.5 cups filtered water',
        '1/8 teaspoon (should be around 750mg) champagne yeast (Red Star Premier Blanc formerly known as Pastuer Champagne)',
        '2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice',

        '2L PET bottle (i.e. plastic soda bottle)',
    ],
    recipe: [
        'Clean 2L PET bottle with StarSan soln.',
        'Place ginger, sugar, and 1/2 cup of the water into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, cover, and allow to steep for 1 hour.',
        'Pour the syrup through a fine strainer, cheese cloth over a bowl, or t-shirt, using pressure to get all the juice out of the mixture. Rapidly chill in an ice bath and stir until the mixture reaches 70 degrees F.',
        'Pour the syrup into a 2L PET bottle and add yeast, lemon juice, and remaining 7 cups of water. Shake vigorously for five minutes. Let sit in a dark place at room temperature.',
        'At 2 days, burp and refrigerate bottle. Allow 24 hours for yeast to fall asleep, then siphon off into another StarSan\'d 2L soda bottle, leaving the flocculated yeast at the bottom of the first bottle. SG check. Keep chilled and drink quickly; the carbonation will not last long -- 3 days is safe',
