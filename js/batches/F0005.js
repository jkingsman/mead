Stirred with a drill attachment and the drill bagged in a gallon ziploc to contain dust etc,; it was fantastic to mix. SG may be low by ~.5lb; squeezed a tiny bit more out of the bottles after SG check. No bubbles after a couple hours, but I found out the top & airlock aren\'t perfectly airtight so that may be why early pressure is leaking out (but I expect once the yeast pass the lag phase it\'ll start up).',
