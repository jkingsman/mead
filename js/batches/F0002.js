        'This is one of my first two meads! This mead uses a stronger yeast that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">should result in a semi-dry mead</span> resulted in a bone dry mead. If it\'s too dry for your liking, you can stir a bit of honey into it to sweeten it up. Just go a bit at a time! Your palate will come to enjoy the dryness (maybe). Enjoy chilled or room temperature; leave the sediment in the bottom of the bottle (although it won\'t hurt you).',
