            'Must prepared. Looking forward to this big batch! Made sure to hydrate yeast per packet instructions first. Stirred with a drill attachment and the drill bagged in a gallon ziploc to contain dust etc,; it was fantastic to mix. SG may be low by ~.5lb; squeezed a tiny bit more out of the bottles after SG check. No bubbles after a couple hours, but I found out the top & airlock aren\'t perfectly airtight so that may be why early pressure is leaking out (but I expect once the yeast pass the lag phase it\'ll start up).',

I\'ll let the HJ batch finish but the main bucket will be stopped, obviously, although the seal is so bad I doubt I\'d visually know if the yeast weren\'t settling in for the long nap. The gallon is airlocked so I\'m happy to just let that one bubble for a bit longer. Came away with 4.08 gallons in the main bucket. Will let settle for a couple weeks and decide if I want to sparkoloid.',
