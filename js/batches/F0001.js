        'This is one of my first two meads! This mead uses a weaker yeast that should result in a sweet mead. This is a small batch and should have a foward honey flavor, low alcohol, and a low- to medium-sweetness. Enjoy chilled or room temperature; leave the sediment in the bottom of the bottle (although it won\'t hurt you).',
